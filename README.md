★ On-the-fly encryption: Footage is encrypted as it is taken. Only encrypted data is written to disk, leaving no traces of recorded videos.

★ Industry standard security: Strongbox uses industry standard AES-256 encryption in GCM mode to provide both confidentiality and integrity.

★ Practical security: Lock feature allows you to instantly close down app to prevent access to recorded videos

★ Export safety: Strongbox allows streaming videos directly to your computer to avoid storing unencrypted footage on your memory cards.
